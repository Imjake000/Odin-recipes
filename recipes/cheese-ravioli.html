        <p>There’s nothing more satisfying than your own homemade pasta, so plan for an afternoon in the kitchen to make spinach ricotta ravioli. This DIY cheesy stuffed pasta is something you’ll want to make again and again.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups DeLallo Whole-Milk Ricotta</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh spinach, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>A pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Homemade Pasta Dough</li>
            <li>DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco Marinara Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To create the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl using only half of the Parmigiano.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, divide your dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the rest of the dough covered in a bowl under a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying out.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough thinly into a long rectangular shape. Using a dough-cutter wheel, cut 2 long rectangular strips of equal size, about 3 inches wide. Working quickly, spoon a rounded teaspoon onto the dough. Do this about 2 inches apart along the pasta sheet. Place the other dough rectangle on top, lining up the edges as best as you can. Press lightly along the edges.</li>
            <li>Using the wheel cutter, first trim off the 4 sides of the rectangle. Next, cut out each square to form ravioli. Seal each with your fingers. To prevent sticking, place finished pasta on a well floured tray.</li>
            <li>Continue this process, preparing as many ravioli as you can, balancing the amount of filling with the remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the ravioli one by one. Stirring them gently to prevent sticking, cook for about 8 minutes. Drain and add hot ravioli to a saucepan with DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco Marinara Sauce.</li>
        </ol>
